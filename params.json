There is a non-free democracy Now! application on the google play store, and so I wrote this. Although this has less features, there are some positives: the videos aren't downloaded to the device (and sucking up memory) but streamed through the browser or VLC (I use VLC).

I have a mock up for this, but nothing as advanced as the non-free's version. Maybe VLC is just simpler AND better.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
