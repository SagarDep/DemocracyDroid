<p>This program parses the <a href="http://democracynow.org">Democracy Now!</a> RSS-feed and it links to the video broadcasts. The application sends the intent to open the video in either the Gallery viewer, VLC (recommended), or the Browser. It uses the SimplisticRss library by <a href="https://github.com/ShirwaM/Simplistic-RSS">ShirwaM</a>
<br>
There is an Android application on the play store that plays Democracy Now! feed. It is more comprehensive than this one -- but it's closed source. It allows for audio streaming (in the background), saves the location of the listener/viewer, and displays the description of each episode along with the photograph. The Free Democracy Now! application doesn't do those things, although it does link (under 'donate') to democracynow.org, which the non-free application doesn't do. I was trying to copy it, but even the simple functions of my Free version suffice for my purposes. There are ads in the non-free version and it downloads the videos into the application cache (and runs up a lot of memory) - these are two more features my application doesn't have. : )

<p>Democracy Now is an excellent independent daily news broadcast. <br></p>

<p><b>I have no affiliation with Democracy Now!</b> (they won't even return my emails). Insofar as I lack these credentials, Google Play store will not accept this application, for intellectual property reasons. I'm pretty sure, though, that Democracy Now broadcasts are Creative Commons, but I can't get a definitive answer. Anyway, if you don't feel like compiling the code, in the "app" directory there is an "app-release.apk" which is the binary of this application. Enjoy : ).</p>
